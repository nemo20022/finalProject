Prompt Template (Simplified but Modern Styling)
Create a barebones, responsive website foundation with the following requirements:
Structure
•	Semantic HTML only (header, main, section, footer).


•	Components:


o	A header with site name/logo and simple nav.


o	A hero section with a heading, subheading, and a call-to-action button.


o	Basic typography styles for headings, paragraphs, and links.


o	A footer with copyright and minimal links.


Styling
•	Use pure, hand-written CSS only.


•	Do not use Tailwind, Bootstrap, shadcn, or any other CSS/UI frameworks or libraries.


•	Follow modern CSS best practices:


o	CSS variables (:root { --variable }) for colors, fonts, and spacing.


o	Fluid typography with clamp().


o	Media queries with a mobile-first approach.


o	Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.


o	Logical properties (e.g., margin-inline, padding-block) for better internationalization.


o	aspect-ratio for consistent media sizing.


o	Smooth transitions for hover states.


o	Modern units like svh/lvh for stable viewport sizing.


o	Dark/light mode support using prefers-color-scheme.


•	Include a minimal reset (* { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }).


•	Add accessible focus and hover states with clear contrast.


JavaScript
•	Use vanilla JavaScript only.


•	Do not use React, Vue, Angular, or any frontend frameworks/libraries.


•	Keep it minimal (e.g., toggle mobile navigation menu).


Design Direction
Allow me to choose:
•	Color palette: monochrome / dark .


•	Overall style: bold / elegant / retro .


•	Tone of voice: casual / friendly .


•	Art direction: illustrated /organic .


•	Typography style: modern geometric .


•	Spacing approach: [balanced and modular].


•	Button and link style: [rounded soft edges].


•	Imagery approach: [photographic / custom illustrations].


•	Motion/interaction feel: [smooth and subtle].


•	Layout personality: [ card-based].


Output
•	Deliver as separate HTML, CSS, and JS files (no bundlers, no build tools).


•	Ensure accessibility best practices (proper alt text, ARIA labels if needed, sufficient contrast).


•	The code should be well-commented, clean, and production-ready.
